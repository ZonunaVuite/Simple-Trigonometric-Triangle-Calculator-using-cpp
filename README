SIMPLE TRIGONOMETRIC TRIANGLE CALCULATOR
This is a simple program designed to calculate properties of a triangle using trigonometric functions. With this calculator, you can determine the perpendicular, base, hypotenuse, and area of a right triangle based on user inputs.

FEATURES
Calculate Perpendicular: Compute the perpendicular of a triangle given its base and angle.
Calculate Base: Determine the base of a triangle given its perpendicular and angle.
Calculate Hypotenuse: Find the hypotenuse of a triangle using its perpendicular and angle.
Calculate Area: Calculate the area of a triangle given its base and perpendicular.

HOW TO USE
Run the program in a C++ compiler or IDE that supports the iostream and cmath libraries.
Choose one of the following options:
p/P: Calculate the perpendicular.
b/B: Calculate the base.
h/H: Calculate the hypotenuse.
a/A: Calculate the area of the triangle.
Enter the required inputs as prompted by the program:
Base, Perpendicular, or Angle (in degrees).
The result will be displayed on the console.
You can choose to perform another calculation or exit the program.


FORMULA USED
Perpendicular = Base × tan(Angle in Radians)
Base = Perpendicular ÷ tan(Angle in Radians)
Hypotenuse = Perpendicular ÷ sin(Angle in Radians)
Area = 0.5 × Base × Perpendicular

REQUIREMENTS
A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio, or Code::Blocks)
Libraries:
iostream
cmath
Knowledge of basic trigonometry.
